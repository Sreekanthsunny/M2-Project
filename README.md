A digital soil moisture meter is used for indicating the water content of a given soil sample. As crop production requires water at different stages and in different amounts, it is important to measure soil moisture from time to time to know its status.
The digital soil moisture meter circuit presented here, for monitoring the soil moisture content in irrigation farms, is an electronic device that measures soil moisture content accurately and precisely. It measures the resistance of flow of the electric current between two metallic probes. These probes act as sensor elements that register moisture and change it into an electric value. This value is further processed into information in the form of an electronic display.
Front-end of the digital soil moisture meter is a simple soil moisture sensor head, built around a few easily-available parts. Working of the sensor head electronics is self-explanatory, so just follow the conceptual drawing (and schematic drawing) shown in Fig. 1 to proceed with its construction.
